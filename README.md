# ipfs-web-server

This repository has been deprecated in favor of the following new code repositories:
- [docker-gatsby-webserver](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/docker-gatsby-webserver) is a Docker container for publishing a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) website to the clear web, Tor, and IPFS simultaneously. This is the web server used by [UncensorablePublishing.com](https://uncensorablepublishing.com).

- [ipfs-site-mirror](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-site-mirror) is the next evolution of this code repository. It is a simple node.js JavaScript app to mirror and serve an IPFS website published with the docker-gatsby-webserver repo above, using the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain to coordinate the mirrors. This repo is useful for people to coordinate to fight censorship, by easily creating mirrors of websites that are under attack.
